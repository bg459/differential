The datasets we used for the analysis can be found on the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) dataset. To construct the differential network, we used GSE65204, GSE64913, and GSE63142. This differential network is from the literature, and can be found here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012377v1.

We validate our results on the GEO dataset GSE35571.
